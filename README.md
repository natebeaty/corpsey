The Infinite Corpse is an online collaborative comic that is open to everyone in the world who makes or wants to make comics.

Each new artist is asked to follow another artist's 3 panels with their own. Each artist is allowed to take the comic anywhere they want (a few seconds forward, a million years in the future, 20 years in the past, etc) as long as they follow the 7 simple rules.

Each contribution is moderated by panel of artists from the Chicago artist collective Trubble Club.

Built using the Django framework.
