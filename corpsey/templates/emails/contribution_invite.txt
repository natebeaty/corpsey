--THE SEVEN RULES:---------------------------------

The Infinite Corpse is an online collaborative comic that has an open call for submissions. Everyone in the world can participate. We're particularly looking for outstanding efforts in humor, creativity and/or draftsmanship. We want this to be open to everyone, but in order to keep it going it has to be outstanding, and all contributions will need to pass a degree of quality control.

So in addition to outstanding effort, we also need these seven rules followed.

- The actions within the panels must be clear and easy to read.

- Three perfectly square panels which directly follow the previous artist's panels, in your own style, in your own palette. Paint/sculpt/photograph/sew/draw Corpsey how YOU would represent him, not necessarily how the artist before you did. (He's a skeleton with ripped pants! That's it!) Black and white or color are both encouraged. We'd love it to be a wonderful patchwork of all sorts of things, but no halftones please. (Example of halftone: http://bit.ly/x7fwbv)

- The main character Corpsey must always be somewhere in the comic. He is already dead, so you cannot kill him. Your panels cannot be the end of the story.

- Keep it PG-13. (We'd like this to be a place where anybody can come and draw and contribute. What PG-13 means http://www.mpaa.org/film-ratings/)

- Panels must be RGB, square, and at least 1200px by 1200px. Save files as JPG.

- Please DO NOT include characters from your own comics, or others already created. We want this to be 100% original.

- Do not post your panels online until they have been up on The Infinite Corpse

If our panel of judges have any problems with your submission, your comic will not be posted and you will get a message briefly explaining why. Good luck!
